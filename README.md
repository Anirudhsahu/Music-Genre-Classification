## Music Genre Classification
This repository hosts a machine-learning project that classifies music into specific genres by analyzing audio data. The project utilizes the GTZAN dataset for training and validating a genre classification model, offering a user-friendly interface for real-time genre prediction.

## Features
Data Analysis: In-depth analysis of audio data to extract meaningful insights, which inform feature selection and model training strategies.

Machine Learning Model: Developing a robust model for classifying music into various genres based on extracted features.

Genre Prediction: Ability to predict the genre of music from audio files using the trained machine learning model.

User Interface: A simple, intuitive UI built with PyQt5 allows users to seamlessly upload audio files and view predicted genres.

## Dataset
The GTZAN dataset used in this project is available for download here. This dataset includes 1,000 audio tracks evenly distributed across 10 music genres, each lasting 30 seconds.

## Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.x

PyQt5
